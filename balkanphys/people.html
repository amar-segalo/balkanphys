        <p>Dr. <strong> Michael Chirillo</strong> originally hails from South Texas and completed his MD/PhD in 2017 at the McGovern Medical School at the Texas Medical Center in Houston and at the Center for Learning and Memory in Austin. Dr. Chirillo investigated how the structure of mammalian synapses is modified with learning and memory and how subcellular organelles like smooth endoplasmic reticulum coordinate synaptic changes along dendrites in the hippocampus. He completed his internship in internal medicine and pediatrics at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City in 2018 before traveling across the Atlantic to work with various Balkan medical and biology faculties on a Fulbright Scholar Grant, an award given through the US Department of State to send American researchers abroad. Dr. Chirillo is now a research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin and is currently based in Trieste collaborating with a group of physiologists on a new textbook concerning the physiology of marine animals. He continues to investigate the synaptic processes that go awry in patients with intellectual disabilities with colleagues in the US. While not working at the computer, you can find Dr. Chirillo tending vegetables in his garden, planning his next trip to Southeastern Europe, or trying with all his might to learn any of a number of Balkan languages.

       <p>Dr. <strong>Amina Valjevac</strong> teaches human physiology to medical, dental, pharmacy, and healthcare students at the Medical Faculty of the University of Sarajevo. After completing her medical studies, Dr. Valjevac specialized in internal medicine at the Clinical Center University in Sarajevo.  She received her PhD from the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Sarajevo in 2013, was appointed docent in 2014, and was promoted to associate professor in 2019. For her thesis, Dr. Valjevac investigated cross-talk between bone remodeling and adipokines.
           <br>
           <br>

        During her PhD, she also worked with colleagues at the University of Geneva investigating tight junction signaling in insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells. From that point on, she has had a love-hate relationship with western blotting but usually sticks to ELISA and immunohistochemistry. She has participated as co-investigator in several projects looking into the roles played by the genetics of the Bosnian population in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases, projects supported by the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education. She gained experience in improving and implementing new educational methods in human physiology at the Institute of Physiology at the Medical Faculty of the University of Oslo. Amina has published more than 50 scientific papers and is an active member of the Central Europe Action Group of the European Calcified Tissue Society as well as the current B&H MC member of the “GEnomics of MusculoSkeletal traits TranslatiOnal Network” project. Amina enjoys hiking and mountain biking during the day.

       <p>Dr. <strong>Selma Spahić</strong> is a teaching assistant in the Department of Physiology at the Medical Faculty in Sarajevo. She began after completing her medical studies in 2018. As a student, she completed several clerkships throughout Europe and wrote her thesis on an assessment of tactile sensitivity in healthy subjects using the two-point discrimination test. Selma has become very involved in teaching and she currently devotes most of her time to learning how to transmit information effectively and competently to the students she works with. While still considering what she’d like to specialize in what field of research she finds most interesting, she is a medical volunteer at the emergency department at Nakas General Hospital in Sarajevo. Selma is a passionate nature enthusiast and art lover. She spends her free time outdoors and loves rock climbing and hiking. If the sun isn’t shining, she’s often painting her thoughts on canvas at home.

        <h3>ASMF</h3>
        <p>The Association of Students of the Faculty of Medicine in Sarajevo (ASMF) began in 2000 as a single representative body of all students at the Faculty of Medicine. Over the past several years, ASMF has proven to be a crucial factor in the preservation and protection of students’ rights and interests at the faculty. ASFM is non-profit, non-political, and non-governmental and is a full member of the Student Parliament of the University of Sarajevo, where students of our faculty have traditionally governed the health disciplines. <br>
            <br>
            ASFM continues to foster a high level of democracy, so that today ASFM consists of an equal number of delegates from each academic year, who make all decisions concerning the association.
